# yaml2urdf_jinja2
This is a very powerful tool in order to introduce some dynamics in the urdf models. The concept is the same that is implemented in "Xacros" from ros.

The idea is to define a function that takes the parameters from a yaml file and create the desired urdf file from a pre-defined template.
